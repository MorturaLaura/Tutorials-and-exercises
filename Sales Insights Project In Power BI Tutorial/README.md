# Sales Insights Power BI Project - Tutorial

For learning in more depth how to work in Power BI, I got through the tutorial playlist:  [Sales Insights Power BI Project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9)
The tutorial is provided by Dhaval Patel on his youtube channel: [CODEBASICS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9nVJoWXmFb7sLApWGcLPQ)

It is a very interesting playlist tutorial for a beginner because it presents a real life project that, at the end, is verified and improved by an experienced data analyst manager working for a company in UK:  [Hemanand Vadivel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemanand-vadivel-0b34aab5/)

The case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in a dynamically changing market. Sales director decides to invest in a data analysis project and he would like to build a Power BI dashboard that can give him real time sales insights.

The data for the project was pulled from the MySql database of the company. The database has all sales transactions, customers, products and markets information necessary for doing the project.

The report that I managed to create by following the tutorial is the following:

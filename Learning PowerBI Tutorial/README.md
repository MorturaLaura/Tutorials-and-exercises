#Learning Power BI Tutorial

I wanted to begin learning how to work in Power BI and do different data analyzes.
I found on Youtube the tutorial [Power BI Tutorial From Beginner to Pro âš¡ Desktop to Dashboard in 60 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGrl-H87pRU&t=3379s)
on the Youtube channel [Avi Singh - PowerBIPro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNmSv7mAPYiC0Y40TJijAw)

It helped me to get into the basic aspects you need to know when working with PowerBI.
The main aspects that the tutorial gets you familiar to are:
* Get Data - connectors and get simple data
* Get Data - query editor overview
* Get Data - cleanup messy data
* Get Data - query editor vs macros
* Relationships - key concepts and creating relationships
* Relationships - explore data using visuals
* Relationships - analyzing data tables together

* DAX - measure vs calculated column (key concept)
* Visuals - 80/20 Rule
* Visuals - text, image, cards, shape
* Visuals - bar/column chart, drill down
* Visuals - conditional formatting
* Visuals - line chart, bar chart
